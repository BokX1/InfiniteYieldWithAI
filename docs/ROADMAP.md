## 🚧 Current Focus: v1.3.x - Stabilization & Polish

*Current Version: v1.3.1*

We are currently in a stabilization phase, ensuring the core architecture introduced in v1.3.0 is rock-solid.

- **Bridge Reliability**: Ensuring the Event-Based Bridge handles all edge cases (disconnects, game switches).
- **Mobile Experience**: Refining touch targets and layout for different screen sizes.
- **Performance**: Optimizing the fuzzy matching and bridge communication to minimize frame drops.

## 📅 Upcoming: v1.4.0 - Advanced Intelligence & Ecosystem

*Target: Q1 2026*

The next major release focuses on expanding the ecosystem and making the AI smarter.

### 🧠 AI & Intelligence

- **Multi-Model Support**: Switch between OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Local LLMs.
- **Conversation Memory**: Short-term context persistence for follow-up commands (e.g., "now make it faster").
- **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware command recommendations based on the current game genre.

### 🔌 Plugin & Extension System

- **Custom Plugin API**: Fully documented API for community-created extensions.
- **Custom Quick Actions**: User-editable mobile command grid.
- **Command Macros**: Record and playback complex command sequences.

### 🎨 UI/UX Overhaul

- **Theme System**: Presets (Dark, Light, OLED) and custom accent colors.
- **In-Game Settings**: Collapsible panel to modify `CONFIG` without editing code.
- **History & Favorites**: Searchable command history and starred commands.
