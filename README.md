# SmartInfiniteYield (SIY) - V1.2.3 Stable

**Original Idea by [VolQ5](https://github.com/BokX1/RbxLuauLLM) | Powered by Pollinations.AI (LLM Model)**

---

## Overview

**SmartInfiniteYield (SIY)** is an open-source, AI-powered wrapper for [Infinite Yield](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield), the popular Roblox admin script. It bridges the gap between natural human language and precise command execution, allowing users to control the game using everyday phrases instead of memorizing syntax.

At its core, SIY features a **Hybrid Dual-Path Execution Engine** that intelligently routes requests through either instant local processing (for 200+ known commands) or AI-powered translation (for complex natural language). The system includes a **Self-Correcting Logic Engine** that validates commands before execution—if the AI targets a non-existent player or generates invalid syntax, the script automatically detects the error, provides context, and forces the AI to correct itself.

Key innovations include **Intelligent Caching** that learns your phrases over time for instant execution, **Fuzzy Player Targeting** using Levenshtein distance matching, and a **Mobile-First Design** with one-tap Quick Actions. Whether you're a power user seeking efficiency or a newcomer who doesn't want to memorize commands, SIY adapts to your workflow.

```
"Make me fly"              →  ;fly
"Teleport to that guy"     →  ;goto PlayerName  
"Go to my base waypoint"   →  ;gotowp base
"Make me super fast"       →  ;speed 100
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need a Roblox Executor that supports `request`, `http_request`, or `fluxus.request`. Standard Roblox Studio cannot run this script due to HTTP header restrictions.

### Quick Start

Copy and execute this script in your executor:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BokX1/InfiniteYieldWithAI/refs/heads/main/InfiniteYieldWithAI.Lua"))()
```

### Development Version

For the latest features (may be unstable):

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BokX1/InfiniteYieldWithAI/refs/heads/main/InfiniteYieldWithAI_Dev.Lua"))()
```

---

## Usage Guide

### The Interface

The main interface consists of three primary elements:

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Input Box** | Type your command or natural language request |
| **Mode Dropdown** | Click to select between CMD (orange) and CHAT (blue) modes |
| **Help (?)** | Reopen the interactive tutorial anytime |
| **Minimize (-)** | Collapse to floating icon |

### CMD Mode (Orange)

CMD Mode translates natural language into Infinite Yield commands and executes them.

**Example 1: Player Targeting**
> **You:** "Fling that bacon hair guy"
> **SIY:** Scans players → Finds "BaconHairUser_99" → Executes `;fling BaconHairUser_99`

**Example 2: Direct Commands**
> **You:** "Fly at speed 50"
> **SIY:** Matches movement database → Executes `;fly 50`

**Example 3: Fuzzy Matching**
> **You:** "kill valk"
> **SIY:** Fuzzy matches "valk" to "Valkorym" → Executes `;kill Valkorym`

### CHAT Mode (Blue)

CHAT Mode provides game-specific advice and information without executing commands.

**Example:**
> **You:** "Where is the safe spot?"
> **SIY:** Detects game is "Tower of Hell" → Returns: *"Stay on the center platforms to avoid the rotating lasers."*

### Mobile Quick Actions

Mobile users can tap the ⚡ button to reveal a 3x3 grid of common commands:

| Row 1 | Row 2 | Row 3 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Fly | Speed | ESP |
| Noclip | Jump | Teleport |
| Invisible | Reset | Anti-Lag |

### Waypoint System

Save and teleport to locations using the waypoint system:

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `swp [name]` | Save current position as waypoint | `swp base` |
| `gotowp [name]` | Teleport to saved waypoint | `gotowp base` |
| `goto [player]` | Teleport to a player | `goto john` |
| `waypoints` | List all saved waypoints | `waypoints` |
| `deletewaypoint [name]` | Delete a waypoint | `deletewaypoint base` |

**Dropdown Suggestions:**
- Type `gotowp ` to see all your saved waypoints
- Type `goto ` to see all players in the server

**Natural Language Examples:**
> **You:** "Save this spot as my farm"
> **SIY:** Executes `;swp farm`

> **You:** "Take me to the farm waypoint"
> **SIY:** Executes `;gotowp farm`

> **You:** "Go to John"
> **SIY:** Executes `;goto john`

---

## Configuration

Customize SIY by modifying the `CONFIG` table at the top of the script:

```lua
local CONFIG = {
    -- API Settings
    ApiKey = "Null",                    -- If set, sent as Authorization: Bearer <key> for AI requests
    Endpoint = "https://...",           -- AI endpoint URL
    Model = "openai",                   -- AI model to use
    MaxRetries = 2,                     -- Retry attempts for failed requests (HTTP 4xx/5xx or executor errors)
    RequestTimeout = 10,                -- Seconds to wait for API response before failing the request
    
    -- Cache Settings
    CacheEnabled = true,                -- Enable intelligent caching
    CacheFile = "SIY_CommandCache.json", -- Local cache filename
    MaxCacheEntries = 100,              -- Maximum cached commands
    
    -- Rate Limiting
    AIRequestCooldown = 0.5,            -- Minimum seconds between AI requests
    
    -- Input Validation
    MaxInputLength = 500,               -- Maximum characters allowed in input
    
    -- UI Timing Constants
    PreviewDelay = 0.3,                 -- Seconds to show preview before execution
    ErrorDisplayTime = 2,               -- Seconds to display error messages
    StatusFadeTime = 3,                 -- Seconds before status text fades
    
    -- Fuzzy Matching
    FuzzyMatchMinThreshold = 2,         -- Minimum Levenshtein distance threshold
    FuzzyMatchRatio = 0.5,              -- Ratio of input length for threshold
}
```

### Configuration Categories

#### Cache System
The intelligent caching system learns your frequently used phrases:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `CacheEnabled` | `true` | Toggle the learning cache on/off |
| `CacheFile` | `SIY_CommandCache.json` | Filename for persistent cache |
| `MaxCacheEntries` | `100` | Maximum phrases to remember |

When you use a phrase like "make me fast" and the AI translates it to `;speed 50`, that mapping is cached. Next time you type the same phrase, it executes instantly without an API call.

#### Security & Rate Limiting

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `AIRequestCooldown` | `0.5` | Prevents spam by enforcing minimum delay between AI requests |
| `MaxInputLength` | `500` | Truncates excessively long inputs for security |
| `RequestTimeout` | `10` | Maximum seconds to wait for API response |

#### Fuzzy Matching

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `FuzzyMatchMinThreshold` | `2` | Minimum edit distance to consider a fuzzy match |
| `FuzzyMatchRatio` | `0.5` | Dynamic threshold = max(MinThreshold, inputLength × Ratio) |.

## Architecture

### Hybrid Dual-Path Engine

SmartInfiniteYield V1.2.2 uses a sophisticated routing system that combines local speed with AI intelligence, wrapped in a streamlined compact interface.

**Path A: Fast Path (Local Execution)**

When you type a known command like `fly` or `speed 50`, the script checks its internal FastMap dictionary containing 200+ regex patterns. If a match is found, execution is instant with zero latency and no API calls.

**Path B: Neuro-Symbolic Bridge (AI Execution)**

For natural language like "kill the guy in red", the script captures the server state (player list, game context) and sends it to the AI. The AI analyzes the request and returns the appropriate command.

### Validation-Retry Loop

The anti-hallucination system prevents errors through recursive validation:

1. AI suggests a command (e.g., `;goto Volcano`)
2. Script validates the target exists
3. If invalid, script sends feedback: `[ERROR: Target 'Volcano' not found. Did you mean 'VolQ5'?]`
4. AI retries with corrected command
5. Valid command executes

### Event-Based Bridge System

Version 1.2.1 introduced an event-based bridge using BindableEvents, replacing the previous polling system. This provides instant bridge connection and eliminates "Bridge not connected" errors.
