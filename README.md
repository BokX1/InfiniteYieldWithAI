**InfiniteYieldWithAI** integrates the famous Lua Roblox script **Infinite Yield** with the **Gemini model**, enabling natural language interaction with Roblox commands.  

This project allows users to execute commands simply by typing human-like instructions, such as:  
```
make me fly
```
➡️ which automatically triggers the `fly` command in Infinite Yield.

  Execute Infinite Yield commands using plain English (e.g., "teleport me to spawn").
- 🎮 **Game Awareness**  
  Chat toggle intelligently adapts to the current Roblox game you’re playing.
- ⚡ **Seamless Integration**  
  Combines the flexibility of Infinite Yield with the power of Gemini AI.
